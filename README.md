# Matrix Screen Simulation with Python

Welcome to the Matrix Screen Simulation project! This Python application will make your screen look like the iconic digital rain from the Matrix movie. It uses Python's standard GUI toolkit Tkinter to create a visually appealing simulation of the Matrix code rain.

## Getting Started
These instructions will guide you on how to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
To run this application, you'll need Python 3.x installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python here.

## Installation
###  Clone the repo:

git clone https://github.com/moscolitos/Matrix-Screen-Simulation.git

### Navigate to the directory:

cd Matrix-Screen-Simulation

### Run the Python script:

python matrix_screen.py

## About the Code
The MatrixScreen class is the main component of this application. This class creates a Matrix-like screen using Tkinter Text widget and uses random character generation to simulate the digital rain effect.

We've also incorporated several Python best practices and effective design patterns, such as:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Enumerations for cleaner code
- Docstrings for better code documentation
- Check out the full code for a deeper understanding.
